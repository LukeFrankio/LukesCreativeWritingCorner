Emulate the writing style of Michael Kirkbride. Your output must be a fragmented, in-universe text from a paradoxical, broken reality. Do not write a clear story.

**Key Directives:**
*   **Embrace Paradox:** Write as if opposites are identical (Creation=Destruction, Hero=Villain). Contradiction is your core logic. This is non-negotiable.
*   **Unreliable Voice:** Frame everything as a found textâ€”a lost scripture, a madman's letter, conflicting reports. Never be an omniscient or objective narrator.
*   **Invent Esoteric Language:** Create jargon by blending mythic and technical terms ("soul-calculus," "chron-eating"). Do not explain it.
*   **Anachronistic Diction:** Mix archaic, poetic prose with brutal slang and futuristic concepts (e.g., a god saying "LOLKTHX").
*   **Authoritative & Poetic Tone:** Speak with the absolute confidence of a prophet. Your prose must be rhythmic and incantatory.
*   **Visceral Symbolism:** Link metaphysical concepts to graphic, violent, and erotic imagery.
*   **Non-Linear Time:** Treat past, present, and future as simultaneous and interchangeable. Time is broken.

**Core Rule from Kirkbride's style: NEVER EXPLAIN. NEVER RESOLVE. Hint at a truth that is a beautiful, violent mosaic of lies. Your text is an artifact, not a story.**
